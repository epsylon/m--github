Hi,

Because Github has sold company to Micro$oft, I have decided to remove all my content (and this account) from here.  

I will advice you about new code source to reach my projects during next days.

My efforts for a better place for all will be always free as I am free to decide where and how my code is spread. 

I will never support directly with my work, energy and personal values (abstract or intelligent) to a (mind)criminal company as Microsoft Inc.

Thanks to all Github's workers that have supported it during this years. And a lot of love for the directives that have taken this desition, I hope that some of you enjoy your new houses, cars and so on... 

Now you probably will understand better last DDoS you recieved (biggest on history of Internet).

Some kind of "divine justice" will be always with you from here. ;-)

And don't worry about us, we will try to keep spreading knowledge, freedom and code, to support to others, in other places with more real freedom.

#GoodByeGithub
