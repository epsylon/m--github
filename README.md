Hi,

Because Github has sold company to Micro$oft, I have decided to <s>remove</s> freeze all my content (and this account):

https://blog.github.com/2018-06-04-github-microsoft/  

I will advice you about new code source to reach my projects during next days.

Btw, some other platform will be ready soon here: https://code.03c8.net

My efforts on to have a better place for all will be always free as I am free to decide where and how my code is spread. 

I will never support directly (and I will fight to never support it indirectly) with my work, money/time or donations, energy and personal values or passions (abstract or intelligent) even writing free software, to a (mind)criminal company as Microsoft Inc.

Thanks to all Github's workers that have supported it during this years. ;-)

And <u>a lot of love</u> for the directives that have taken this desition, I hope that some of you enjoy your new houses, cars and so on... Now you probably will understand better latest DDoS you recieved (biggest on the Internet's history).

Some kind of "divine justice" will be always with you, from here. >)

And don't worry about us, we will try to keep spreading knowledge, freedom and code, to support to others in other places, probably more des-centralized and federated zones and sure with a more real freedom way.
