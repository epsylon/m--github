Hi,

Because Github has sold company to Micro$oft, I have decided to <s>remove</s> freeze all my content (and this account):

https://blog.github.com/2018-06-04-github-microsoft/  

I will advice you about new code source to reach my projects during next days.

Btw, some other platform will be ready soon here: https://code.03c8.net

My efforts on to have a better place for all will be always free as I am free to decide where and how my code is spread. 

I will never support directly (and I will fight to never support it indirectly) with my work, money/time or donations, energy and personal values or passions (abstract or intelligent) even writing free software, to a (mind)criminal company as Microsoft Inc.

Thanks to all Github's workers that have supported it during this years. ;-)

And <u>a lot of love</u> for the directives that have taken this desition, I hope that some of you enjoy your new houses, cars and so on... Now you probably will understand better latest DDoS (mem-cached dummy style) you recieved (biggest on the Internet's history).

Some kind of "divine justice" will be always with you, from here. >)

And don't worry about us, we will try to keep spreading knowledge, freedom and code, to support to others in other places, probably more des-centralized and federated zones and sure with a more real freedom way.
